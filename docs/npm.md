# PiVo craft: npm and headless SDK

## Installation and runtime

After the first manual publication:

```sh
npm install @bookklik/pivo-craft
```

Node.js 24 or newer. This is an ESM-only package with bundled public TypeScript declarations. CommonJS require and a CLI/--headless switch are not supported; headless means the programmatic SDK below. Use dynamic import from CommonJS if needed. Library consumers do not need Vite, TypeScript loaders, a browser or the editor source tree.

## Public entry points

| Import | API |
| --- | --- |
| `@bookklik/pivo-craft` | Combined portable core and IO |
| `@bookklik/pivo-craft/headless` | Alias of the combined API |
| `@bookklik/pivo-craft/core` | Data types, validation and editing |
| `@bookklik/pivo-craft/io` | Portable serialization/encoding/export |
| `@bookklik/pivo-craft/codecs` | Alias of portable IO |

Only documented entries are public. Source paths, lib chunks and editor internals are not exported. Generated declarations are included for each entry. Browser download/storage helpers are not exported by the SDK.

## Example

```js
import { createProject, renderFrame, encodePNG, saveNative } from '@bookklik/pivo-craft/headless';
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const project = createProject(32, 32, 'Sprite');
const pixels = renderFrame(project, project.frames[0].id);
await writeFile('sprite.png', encodePNG(32, 32, pixels));
await writeFile('sprite.pvc', saveNative(project));
```

## Supported headless behavior

The root exports core and codec functions together. The overlapping imageToRGBA name selects the core implementation; the codec implementation is available as codecImageToRGBA or through the /codecs subpath. /codecs aliases /io. Import namespace objects directly from the relevant subpath. The nested @pivo-craft/core manifest is internal/private and is not a separate release dependency.

Calls do not open windows, start servers, contact remote services or access browser storage. You control filesystem access by reading/writing the returned bytes. Preserve native project files as editable backups. Codec/export validation errors reject invalid or unsupported data; do not ignore thrown errors or rejected promises.

The SDK uses the existing bounded project/PNG/codec validators. Headless calls execute in the caller's thread: Promise-returning APIs do not imply background workers. For untrusted batches, isolate work in your own Node worker/process with memory/time budgets and terminate the worker for cancellation. There is no built-in Node worker/progress adapter. Model capture, browser PWA/recovery, and UI interactions remain editor features, not implicit headless capabilities.

## Browser embedding and recovery options

These URL options apply to the full browser editor and standalone HTML, not the UI-free SDK:

| URL option | Header | Editor workspace | Browser recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No option | Visible | Mounted | Enabled |
| `?recovery=off` | Visible | Mounted | Disabled |
| `?embed=1` | Hidden | Mounted | Disabled |

For example, load `/pivo-craft/?embed=1` directly or as an iframe's `src`. Keep the iframe sized to the space allocated by the host. If the URL already has a query string, append `&embed=1` instead. This is visual embedding, distinct from importing the headless SDK.

Embedded mode hides only `.suite-header` and removes its layout space. Document/mode tabs, context toolbars, side panels, canvas, timeline where applicable, and status UI remain mounted. The hidden header is excluded from layout, accessibility navigation, and keyboard focus; its internal DOM is retained so existing editor command wiring stays intact. Native keyboard shortcuts, including Ctrl/Cmd+S for project downloads, continue to work. This option does not add a cross-origin postMessage/host-control bridge.

`?recovery=off` disables discovery, legacy migration, recovery prompts, background autosaves, and recovery reads/writes/deletions for that page session. It does not erase existing backups. The status strip shows **Browser recovery disabled**. Remove the option and reload to resume normal recovery. `recovery=false` and `recovery=0` are aliases; `embed=true` and `embed=on` enable embedded mode. Embedded mode always disables recovery, even with `recovery=on` in the same URL.

Unsaved-change warnings remain active. PWA updates are blocked while unsaved documents have no recovery copy; download all current projects before updating. Theme, workspace, tutorial preferences, and PWA asset caching are separate features and are not disabled by the recovery flag. This is not a private/incognito or storage-free browsing mode.

The headless SDK already performs no browser recovery lookup or automatic persistence and needs neither URL option. To validate the browser modes after `npm run build`, use `npm run test:embed`; it exercises desktop and compact Chromium layouts, hidden-header spacing, native keyboard saving, and absence of recovery storage access. Set `PIVO_BROWSERS=chromium,firefox,webkit` to run the same checks in all three engines.

## Embed with a custom UI or no UI

The root and `/headless` entries export `createHeadlessEditor` and the `HeadlessEditor` TypeScript interface. Each instance owns an isolated project; it does not mount the editor, touch the DOM/storage, register service workers, start a server, or render a viewport. Use it in your host application's framework or a Node job, with the existing core operations and IO exporters.

```js
import { createHeadlessEditor, createProject } from '@bookklik/pivo-craft/headless';

const editor = createHeadlessEditor(createProject());
editor.transact(draft => {
  draft.name = 'Embedded project';
});
const project = editor.getProject();
```

- `getProject()` returns a detached snapshot, including Craft pixel buffers. Mutating it does not edit the instance.
- `transact(callback)` edits a private draft and validates before atomically adopting a detached copy. Throws, invalid documents, Promise/thenable callbacks, and reentrant mutations leave the previous project intact. Callbacks must be synchronous; await external work before opening a transaction. Late writes to a retained draft cannot change committed state.
- `replace(project)` validates and detaches a replacement before adopting it. The seed and replacement remain caller-owned.

Call your renderer or framework's state setter with `editor.getProject()` after a successful edit. Export that snapshot using this package's IO APIs. Persistence, rendering, subscriptions, undo/redo, and worker scheduling are explicit host responsibilities; the adapter does not silently persist changes or retain an undo history. Existing lower-level history/store APIs remain available separately. For React, create one instance per mounted editor rather than one on every render. For servers, create one instance per document/job, never a shared global editor for multiple tenants.

The adapter is headless application logic, not an iframe bridge, a DOM editor widget, an HTTP API, or a CLI flag. Large validation/export calls still run in the calling thread. For untrusted input, use worker/process isolation and external memory/time limits in addition to the built-in format budgets. Embedded browser hosts must bundle the ESM package and its production dependencies; the browser UI and its PWA/recovery code are not needed.

## Build and artifact validation

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build:lib
npm run check:package
npm run check:consumer
npm run release:check
```

The browser build remains npm run build and writes dist/. The separate SDK build writes lib/; prepack rebuilds it automatically. Do not publish dist/ as the library. Runtime dependencies exclude browser-only fonts/icons/frameworks. Required dependency licenses/notices are included in the allowlisted tarball.

check:package inspects the exact npm pack inventory and public imports. check:consumer creates a real tarball, installs it outside the repo with production dependencies only, exercises basic portable operations, and strictly compiles/emits NodeNext consumer declarations with no DOM library. Its temporary directory is removed even on failure. These are package/consumer smoke checks, not the unit suite. release:check also checks dependencies and builds the browser app/docs. No listed check invokes npm test or browser suites; ask before running unit tests.

## Manual publication (one project at a time)

From this project's root:

```sh
npm run release:check
npm pack
npm publish --dry-run --access public
npm publish --access public
```

Only run the final command when you intend to publish. No workflow publishes automatically. Confirm npm login, package-name ownership and version availability first; registry E404 does not guarantee ownership. Before later releases, choose an unused semver version. prepublishOnly rejects npm audit vulnerabilities except the narrowly scoped, expiring deepmerge exception documented in the [dependency policy](production-readiness.md#dependency-policy-updated-28-october-2026); prepack builds/checks the artifact and never runs unit tests. If publishing a previously created tarball rather than the project directory, run the release checks before packing: npm cannot rebuild a tarball for you. Configure provenance/trusted publishing according to your npm account if desired; no credentials are stored here.

The npm archive intentionally includes lib/, this document, README, LICENSE and the relevant third-party notices. Source, tests, tooling, app dist/ and standalone HTML are excluded. The root package has no dependency on another PiVo package: each can be published independently.

The gifenc implementation is bundled into the ESM output to avoid its legacy CommonJS named-export mismatch in Node. Its MIT notice is included. Other external libraries needed at runtime are declared as production dependencies.
