# Production readiness — 13 October 2026

This release hardens the existing local-first editor. Artwork stays on the device; app assets load from the hosting origin. Browser recovery is separate from downloaded native projects.

## Release gate

This commit includes the readiness implementation and UI follow-ups. It has not been deployed; the source fingerprint below identifies the validated snapshot. For this implementation, explicit user permission authorized unit execution: all 256 tests passed. Future unit execution requires permission or manual workflow dispatch. Pushes to main automatically run the release workflow, which checks out one exact commit and runs builds, dependency checks and browser checks before publishing that same artifact. Unit validation runs only when the release workflow or Manual unit validation is manually dispatched. Push and pull-request workflows never execute unit tests.

## Recovery and compatibility

Recovery v2 uses IndexedDB with a unique ID per live browser session. Legacy data is copied durably before a Restore/Discard decision removes the original. Invalid recovery remains downloadable. Discard compares the selected record against the current stored record before deletion. Copies do not expire automatically; File → Recovery manages older sessions explicitly.

Native project format version 1 remains unchanged. Recovery writes are serialized, and feedback reflects the stored snapshot. Visibility changes request a best-effort flush; closing/crashing a browser cannot guarantee an asynchronous write finishes. Download an editable project backup regularly. Storage denial/quota errors must preserve editing and native downloads.

## Browser support and storage limits

Target browsers are current desktop Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. Windows Chromium/Firefox/WebKit were exercised; actual Edge/Safari installations still require release smoke checks.

Craft accepts imports up to 128 MiB and bounds native decompression to 256 MiB. The editor limits open documents to eight tabs and a combined estimated 128 MiB; each tab has a 32 MiB history budget. Raster dimensions are capped at 8,192 per side and 16,777,216 pixels. History keeps at least the newest complete undo transaction, so one unusually large transaction can exceed its nominal byte budget. IndexedDB quota is browser/origin-dependent and can be denied or cleared; there is no fixed recovery quota guarantee. Stored copies are never silently evicted. Use File → Recovery to download and explicitly discard obsolete copies. Use Save project to keep `.pvc`, `.pvo` or `.pvp` backups outside browser storage.

## Runtime and packaging

File operations use bounded worker jobs; cancellation terminates the job without replacing the document. Hosted assets are split from worker/export code. Standalone HTML embeds code, fonts, and workers, disables PWA registration, and supports file:// native downloads. Graphics failures retain native-file controls. WebGL recovery cancels unfinished gestures and rebuilds the viewport.

PWA updates wait for an explicit decision in each tab and a successful recovery flush. Editing is briefly locked during that flush and worker activation, so new edits cannot escape the stored snapshot. Accepting an update in another tab never forces this tab to reload. Active gestures, dialogs and exports defer updates. Application assets are cached; documentation is online-only. Standalone HTML and documentation routes are excluded from the app navigation fallback.

## Dependency policy (updated 27 October 2026)

The npm SDK release replaces the historical documentation-server exceptions with a zero-advisory gate. VitePress 1.6.4 uses an explicit nested Vite 6.4.5 override; fast-uri and serialize-javascript are pinned to patched transitive versions in the root overrides. Browser and documentation builds were checked with these resolutions. `npm run check:dependencies` rejects any reported advisory and runs npm without shell interpolation. See the [npm guide](npm.md) for package preparation and manual publication.

## Validation limits

Chromium represents Chrome/Edge engine coverage; Playwright WebKit is engine coverage, not certification on an actual macOS Safari installation. Current browser checks cover native round trips, malformed input, export signatures, compact layouts, menus, offline reload, deferred/accepted updates across tabs, invalid recovery backups, separate sessions, denied storage, quota exhaustion and aborted recovery writes. Craft/Plate also cover edits during saves and undo back to saved content; Ortho/Plate cover WebGL context loss/restoration with native backups available. Standalone native downloads were checked in all three engines. Full screen-reader conformance, native 200% browser zoom, hardware performance certification and full feature/export semantics remain release checks; historical tests are not current evidence.

The currently deployed public service worker and its precached assets were captured with SHA-256 hashes. An isolated bootstrap client verifies that the new worker stays waiting while the predecessor controls a live client, then activates after closure and preserves legacy recovery bytes plus native downloads. This passed in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. It covers the exact deployed worker lifecycle; the entire historical editor UI and every previously installed release are not certified. No live deployment occurred.

The bootstrap is served under the existing docs navigation exclusion so it stays isolated from the editor. It waits for activation, then navigates to a precached icon to acquire a controlled client without starting the predecessor editor, even when the predecessor does not claim its first client. Changed workers must remain waiting until the controlled client closes; an uncontrolled observer waits for activation instead of relying on a fixed delay. Byte-identical workers exercise recovery and native downloads without expecting a replacement worker. The report records worker hashes, whether the worker changed, and the failing lifecycle stage plus browser errors when a check fails.

## Release and rollback

Automated pushes to main validate and deploy once; the separate readiness workflow runs on pull requests or manual dispatch, not again on main pushes. Browser jobs are pinned to Ubuntu 24.04 and default to Chromium headless-shell-only installation and execution (`PIVO_BROWSERS=chromium`). Enable `full_browser_validation` when manually dispatching readiness or release to include Firefox and WebKit. Manual browser validation does not authorize unit tests; release units require the separate `run_unit_tests` opt-in, or use Manual unit validation. Local browser scripts still default to all three engines when `PIVO_BROWSERS` is unset. npm package validation remains unchanged and browser-free.

1. Review and commit the changes, including lockfiles, shared manifests and this report.
2. Explicitly run unit validation or dispatch Manual unit validation at that commit. The working-tree pass below does not certify a later commit.
3. Run `npm run build`, `npm run docs:build`, `npm run build:standalone`, `npm run check:suite`, `npm run check:dependencies`, and `npm run test:release`, and `npm run test:standalone`. Browser checks require `npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit`.
4. Push the release commit to main to deploy automatically. To also run unit validation, explicitly dispatch the release workflow on main with `run_unit_tests` enabled. It validates the triggering SHA, captures the deployed predecessor with `npm run capture:predecessor`, runs `npm run test:upgrade`, and packages that same SHA. Deployment depends on all applicable validation passing. Predecessor capture reads public app assets; the browser tests use isolated local profiles.
5. Smoke-check the hosted app/docs, an installed PWA update, and an editable backup after release. To roll back, restore the known-good app commit and dispatch its release pipeline. Keep recovery v2 readable or download backups before returning to a build that only reads legacy storage; never delete databases during rollback.

## Repository findings

P1 denotes high severity (artwork/recovery risk); P2 denotes moderate severity (runtime, budget or contract reliability). Listed remediations are implemented and validated unless a limitation is stated above.

| P1 | Recovery accumulates with no convenient raw backup for invalid entries | Per-session v2 records, raw backups, explicit selected-copy cleanup and legacy migration | apps/editor/src/main.ts; suite-recovery.ts |
| P2 | Undo → new edit counts discarded redo memory; edits can exceed aggregate document budget | Redo accounting releases discarded entries; budget rejection rolls back atomically | packages/core/src/history.ts; apps/editor/src/main.ts |
| P2 | Saving a cloned snapshot changes image IDs and makes dirty comparisons unreliable | Identity-preserving snapshots and semantic saved-state comparison | apps/editor/src/main.ts |
| P2 | Synchronous archive operations block the UI | Worker save/import with cancellation; synchronous codec API retained | apps/editor/src/archive.ts |
| P1 | Accept an update in one tab while another has unsaved edits | Per-tab reload consent; editing lock during accepting-tab recovery and activation; file worker code retained before cache replacement | apps/editor/src/suite-pwa.ts; apps/editor/src/suite-worker.ts |

## Verification record

The verification commit is pending review/commit. The base commit identifies the audited starting point; the fingerprint identifies current source bytes. The SHA-256 fingerprint hashes sorted Git-tracked/nonignored source paths plus file bytes, excluding this report and its self-referential JSON record. Generated builds and browser artifacts are ignored. Run the manual release gate again for the final committed SHA.

```


Independent current-output inspection passed for PNG/GIF images through Pillow and for ZIP integrity, OBJ indices, glTF buffers and GLB/embedded textures through separate Python readers. This establishes file readability and structural integrity, not complete visual equivalence with every external editor.

`npm run test:browser` now runs the verified production matrix with current menu/export selectors. `test:browser:legacy` preserves the specialized historical runners; they are not a current release gate and their broader UI assertions need a separate refresh before relying on their results.

## Development-worker follow-up — 13 October 2026

Reproduction: run the Vite development server, make an edit and wait for recovery. The shared adapter started Vite's import-containing module code as a classic Blob worker, causing `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. Production and standalone bundles did not expose this failure. Development now starts a module worker from its original Vite URL; bundled workers retain their self-contained Blob path. Craft suppresses identical recovery notifications until a successful write or a different failure.

`npm run test:workers` covers development autosave and native save/open in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit and is included in automatic browser checks. Craft also verifies repeated identical recovery errors do not keep resetting the notification. All six app/engine development checks passed. Unit suites were not rerun for this follow-up; the unit totals above belong to the previously authorized readiness validation.

## Menu and About follow-up — 13 October 2026

File/Edit/View/Help now share popup styling, 288-pixel width, 32-pixel rows, font weights, shortcut hints and keyboard behavior. Shared File/View commands appear first; existing editor-specific commands remain in separate sections. Plate's decorative menu icons were removed to match the suite's plain-label presentation. Documentation has moved from the header into each About dialog, which shares title/body/footer styling and one Close action. Escape restores the triggering menu; Tab stays in the About actions. Source references: the vendored `suite.ts`/`suite.css` and each app's menu/About adapter.

All 39 app/browser/layout cases passed (Craft 12, Ortho 15, Plate 12) across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, including light/dark and compact/desktop layouts. Ortho's additional checks cover About and native backups without graphics: probing before renderer children mount prevents an unavailable WebGL context from hiding the header. All nine standalone app/engine checks passed for native downloads and absolute documentation URLs. Builds and shared manifests pass; units were not rerun for this follow-up. `npm run test:menus` is included in automated browser validation.

## Shortcut and backdrop follow-up — 13 October 2026

Reproduction: open Help → Keyboard shortcuts in each editor. Ortho showed a static table, Craft opened raw editable chords, and Plate combined its own usage tables; titles, spacing, dismissal controls and modal scrims differed. Shared suite 1.3.0 now provides a 640-pixel reference dialog with a fixed header/footer, scrolling body, Document/Editor/Viewport sections, readable key labels, consistent Close action and focus restoration. Ctrl on Windows/Linux becomes Cmd on macOS; established editor-specific tool bindings remain unchanged. Craft retains current binding customization, validation, import/export, defaults and Apply/Cancel behind Customize bindings. All application modal backdrops use rgba(3,8,13,.6) without blur in light and dark appearances, including About and export. Modal overlays also sit above page notifications so compact Close actions cannot be covered by startup tips.

Source references: canonical/vendored `suite.css` and `suite.ts`; Craft `apps/editor/src/workspace-controls.ts`, Ortho `src/ui/dialogs.tsx`, and Plate `src/main.ts`. `scripts/browser-menus.mjs` verifies presentation, actual content bounds, keyboard focus, key notation and matching scrims. Its expanded matrix passes 84 cases overall (Craft 27, Ortho 30, Plate 27); the standalone runner passes nine app/engine cases including the new shortcut reference. Windows WebKit can report scrollWidth including the vertical scrollbar, so clipping is checked against descendant bounds rather than that metric. Application, documentation and standalone builds plus shared manifests pass. Units were not rerun; their recorded totals remain historical readiness evidence.
